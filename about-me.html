            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Hamza Elafifi and I currently live in Winnipeg, MB. I am currently a grade 10 High School student at the new program called PTEC, Pembina Trails Early College.

                I first came to Canada at the age of 5 in 2010, currently 15 years old and have already planned my future. I am a responsible and respectful worker who takes the time to do their job properly in order to keep my positive personal brand that people already see in me. I am dedicated and dependable to get the job done, efficiently and in the best manner. 
                
                I love Japanese culture, basketball, crafting, cooking, boxing, Arabic, and I LOVE competition. In my spare time, I do shovelling in the winter, babysitting, and yard work. I am currently looking for my next part-time or full-time job.
